# CTIS
This repository details a computed tomography imaging spectrometer (CTIS) simulator, which is designed to simulate the generation of a center zeroth-order and surrounding first-order diffraction spots of a diffractive optical element (DOE). 

A CTIS system is described by a linear imaging equation 
g = Hf
